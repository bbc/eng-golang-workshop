```
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, BBC Gophers!")
}
```

We are on Slack as `#eng-golang`

Our workshop text is:
[The Go Programming Language by Alan Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan](https://www.gopl.io/)

Each week we will complete one chapter then (_optionally_) meet to chat about it.
To join in, create your own directory in the [workspaces](workspaces) directory
with whatever name you chose. Change directory to your workspace and then you
can un-tar the examples there if you wish (or refer to your book).

e.g.
```
cd workspace
mkdir bobbyfoo
cd bobbyfoo
tar xzvf ../../exercises.tar.gz
```

A project structure could be:

```
workspaces
    bobbyfoo\
        exercises\
            ...
        bin\
            helloworld
            ...
        src\
            bobbyfoo.com\
                ch1\
                    ex1_1\
                        main.go
                ...
```

Commit directly to master and fix stuff if it breaks. :)

## Installing Go

###  Home/Linuxbrew
It may be convenient to install the latest version of Go through the
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/) package
managers.

```
brew install go
```


### Install with Binary Distributions
The [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/) page contains distros for
Windows, MacOS, Linux, and source. The
[installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) explains how to
install them.

### Go Modules

_Go modules_ are an experimental opt-in feature in Go 1.11. Follow this
documentation to [install and activate modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#installing-and-activating-module-support).
