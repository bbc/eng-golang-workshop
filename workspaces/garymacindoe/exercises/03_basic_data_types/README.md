# Chapter 3 - Basic Data Types

## Floating-Point Numbers

### Exercise 3.1
If the function `f` retyrns a non-finite `float64` value, the SVG file will
contain invalid `<polygon>` elements (although many SVG renderers handle this
gracefully). Modify the program to skip invalid polygons.

### Exercise 3.2
Experiment with vizualisations of other functions from the `math` package. Can
you produce an egg box, moguls, or a saddle?

### Exercise 3.3
Color each polygon based on its height, so that the peaks are colored red
(`#ff0000`) and the valleys blue ('#0000ff').

### Exercise 3.4
Following the approach of the Lissajous example in Section 1.7, construct a web
server that computes surfaces and writes SVG data to the client. The server must
set the `Content-Type` header like this:
```
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "image/svg+xml")
```
(This step was not required in the Lissajous example because the server uses
standard heuristics to recognize common formats like PNG from the first 512
bytes of the response, and generates the proper header.) Allow the client to
specify values like height, width, and color as HTTP request parameters.

## Complex Numbers

####Â Exercise 3.5
Implement a full-color Mandelbrot set using the function `image.NewRBA` and the
type `color.RGBA` or `color.YCbCr`.

### Exercise 3.6
Supersampling is a technique to reduce the effect of pixelation by computing
the color value at several points within each pixel and taking the average. The
simplest method is to divide each pixel into four "subpixels." Implement it.

### Exercise 3.7
Another simple fractal uses Newton's method to find complex solutions to a
function such as `z^4-1 = 0`. Shade each starting point by the number of
iterations required to get close to one of the four roots. Color each point by
the root it approaches.

### Exercise 3.8
Rendering fractals at high zoom levels demands great arithmetic precision.
Implement the same fractal using four different representations of numbers:
`complex64`, `complex128`, `big.Float`, and `big.Rat`. (The latter two types
are found in the `math/big` package. `Float` uses arbitrary but
bounded-precision floating-point; `Rat` uses unbounded-precision rational
numbers.) How do they compare in performance and memory usage? At what zoom
levels do rendering artefacts become visible?

### Exercise 3.9
Write a web server that renders fractals and writes the image data to the
client. Allow the client to specify the _x_, _y_, and _zoom_ values as
parameters to the HTTP request.

## Strings and Byte Slices

### Exercise 3.10
Write a non-recursive version of `comma`, using `bytes.Buffer` instead of string
concatenation.

### Exercise 3.11
Enhance `comma` so it deals correctly with floating-point numbers and an
optional sign.

### Exercise 3.12
Write a function that reports whether two strings are anagrams of each other,
that is, they contain the same letters in a different order.
