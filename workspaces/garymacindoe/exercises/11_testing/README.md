# Chapter 11 - Testing

### Test Functions

### Exercise 11.1
Write tests for the `charcount` program in Section 4.3

### Exercise 11.2
Write a set of tests of `IntSet` (§6.5) that checks that its behaviour after
each operation if equivalent to a set based on built-in maps. Save your
implementation for benchmarking in Exercise 11.7

## Randomized Testing

### Exercise 11.3
`TestRandomPalindromes` only tests palindromes. Write a randomized test that
generates and verifies _non_-palindromes.

### Exercise 11.4
Modify `randomPalindrome` to exercise `IsPalindrome`'s handling of punctuation
and spaces.

## Writing Effective Tests

### Exercise 11.5
Extend `TestSplit` to use a table of inputs and expected outputs.

## Benchmark Functions

### Exercise 11.6
Write benchmarks to compare the `PopCount` implementation in Section 2.6.2 with
your solutions to Exercise 2.4 and Exercise 2.5. At what point does the table-
based approach break even?

### Exercise 11.7
Write benchmarks for `Add`, `UnionWith`, and other methods of `*IntSet` (§6.5)
using large pseudo-random inputs. How fast can you make these methods run? How
does the choice or word size affect performance? How fast is `IntSet` compared
to a set implementation based on the built-in `map` type?
