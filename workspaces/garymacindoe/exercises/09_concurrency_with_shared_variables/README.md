# Chapter 9 - Concurrency with Shared Variables

## Race Conditions

#### Exercise 9.1
Add a function `Withdraw(amount int) bool` to the `gopl.io/ch9/bank1` program.
The result should indicate whether the transaction succeeded or failed due to
insufficient funds. The message sent to the monitor goroutine must contain both
the amount fo withdraw and a new channel over which the monitor goroutine must
contain both the amount to withdraw and a new channel over which the monitor
goroutine can send the boolean result back to `Withdraw`.

### Lazy Inisialization: `sync.Once`

#### Exercise 9.2
Rewrite the `PopCount` example from Section 2.6.2 so that it initializes the
lookup table using `sync.Once` the first time it is needed. (Realistically, the
cost of syncronization would be prohibitive for a small and highly optimized
function like `PopCount`.)

## Example: Concurrent Non-Blocking Cache

### Exercise 9.3
Extend the `Func` type and the `(*Memo).Get` method so that callers may provide
an optional `done` channel through which they can cancel the operation (§8.9).
The results of a cancelled `Func` call should not be cached.

## Growable Stacks

### Exercise 9.4
Construct a pipeline that connects an arbitrary number of goroutines with
channels. What is the maximum number of pipeline stages you can create without
running out of memory? How long does a value take to transit the entire
pipeline?

## Goroutine Scheduling

### Exercise 9.5
Write a program with two goroutines that send messages back and forth over two
unbuffered channels in ping-pong fashion. How many communications per second can
the program sustain?

## GOMAXPROCS

### Exercise 9.6
Measure how the performance of a compute-bound parallel program (see Exercise
8.5) varies with `GOMAXPROCS`. What is the optimal value on your computer? How
many CPUs does your computer have?
