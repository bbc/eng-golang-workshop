# Chapter 6 - Methods

## Example: Bit Vector Type

####Â Exercise 6.1
Implement these additional methods:
```
  func (*IntSet) Len() int      // return the number of elements
  func (*IntSet) Remove(x int)  // remove x from the set
  func (*IntSet) Clear()        // remove all elements from the set
  func (*IntSet) Copy() *IntSet // return a copy of the set
```

### Exercise 6.2
Define a varadic `(*IntSet).AddAll(...int)` method that allows a list of values
to be added, such as `s.AddAll(1, 2, 3)`.

### Exercise 6.3
`(*IntSet).UnionWith` computes the union of two sets using `|`, the
word-parallel bitwise OR operator. Implement methods for
`IntersectionWith,DifferenceWith`, and `SymmetricDifference` for the
corresponding set operations. (The symmetric difference of two sets contains the
elements present in one set or the other but not both.)

### Exercise 6.5
The type of each word used by `IntSet` is `uint64`, but 64-bit arithmetic may be
inefficient on a 32-bit platform. Modify the program to use the `uint` type,
which is the most efficient unsigned integer type for the platform. Instead of
dividing by 64, define a constant holding the effective size of `uint` in bits,
32 or 64. You can use the perhaps too-clever expression `32 << (^uint(0) >> 63)`
for this purpose.
